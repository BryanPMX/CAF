# üß™ CAF System - Production Testing Suite

A comprehensive testing framework for the CAF (Centro de Apoyo Familiar) system designed for safe production testing, monitoring, and validation.

## üìã Overview

This testing suite provides multiple layers of testing to ensure system reliability and performance in production environments:

- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health checks
- **Smoke Tests**: Daily critical path validation
- **Load Testing**: Performance validation under stress
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow verification
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time system metrics

## üéØ Testing Philosophy

### Safe Production Testing
- **Non-destructive by default**: Most tests are read-only
- **Test data isolation**: All test data is clearly marked and automatically cleaned up
- **Gradual impact**: Tests start with low impact and scale up
- **Immediate rollback**: Ability to stop tests instantly if issues arise

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Health checks**: System component status
- **User journeys**: Critical workflows from end-user perspective  
- **Performance**: Response times and throughput under load
- **Data integrity**: Complete CRUD operations with cleanup

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your production URLs and credentials
nano .env
```

### Essential Setup

1. **Create Test Users**: Set up dedicated test accounts in your production system
   - Regular user: `test@caf-mexico.org`
   - Admin user: `admin@caf-mexico.org`
   - Use strong passwords and limit permissions to test data only

2. **Configure Alerts**: Set up Slack/email notifications for test failures
   ```bash
   export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
   export EMAIL_ALERT="alerts@caf-mexico.org"
   ```

3. **Verify Health Endpoints**: Ensure all health endpoints are accessible
   ```bash
   ./health-monitor.sh quick
   ```

## üè• Health Monitoring

### Continuous Health Checks

Monitor all system components every 30 seconds:

```bash
# Single health check
./health-monitor.sh

# Continuous monitoring
./health-monitor.sh monitor

# Quick check (basic endpoints only)
./health-monitor.sh quick

# Test specific endpoint
./health-monitor.sh test /health/ready
```

### Health Endpoints Monitored

| Endpoint | Purpose | Expected Response Time |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `/health` | Basic service health | < 100ms |
| `/health/ready` | Database connectivity | < 200ms |
| `/health/live` | AWS ALB health check | < 100ms |
| `/health/migrations` | Database migrations | < 300ms |
| `/health/s3` | S3 storage connectivity | < 500ms |
| `/health/cache` | Cache system status | < 100ms |

### Alert Configuration

Health monitoring automatically sends alerts when:
- Any health endpoint fails
- Response times exceed thresholds
- Error rates spike above 1%

## üî• Smoke Tests

### Daily Smoke Testing

Run comprehensive smoke tests to verify critical user journeys:

```bash
# Run all smoke tests
npm run smoke-tests

# Run with custom configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://api.caf-mexico.org/api/v1 npm run smoke-tests
```

### Test Coverage

3. **Sustained** (120s): 10 users/second
4. **Peak** (60s): 15 users/second
5. **Cool-down** (30s): 5 users/second

## üîß Integration Tests

### End-to-End Workflow Testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Integration tests create and modify production data. Only run during maintenance windows with proper backups.

```bash
# Dry run (safe - no data changes)
DRY_RUN=true npm run integration-tests

# Live run (creates test data)
npm run integration-tests

# With custom admin credentials
ADMIN_TEST_EMAIL=admin@caf-mexico.org npm run integration-tests
```

### Test Workflows

   - Create case with client information
   - Add comments and documents
   - Update case status and priority
   - Verify data integrity
   - Clean up test data

2. **Appointment Booking Flow**
   - Create appointment with case linkage
   - Modify appointment details
   - Verify calendar integration
   - Clean up test data

3. **Task Management**
   - Create tasks linked to cases
   - Update task status and assignments
   - Add task comments
   - Clean up test data

4. **Search and Filtering**

# Smoke tests daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/testing && npm run smoke-tests >> /var/log/caf-smoke.log 2>&1

# Load tests weekly on Sundays at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/testing && npm run load-test >> /var/log/caf-load.log 2>&1
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Production Health Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # Every 30 minutes
  
jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Health Check
        run: |
          cd testing
          ./health-monitor.sh
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Health Check Failures
```bash
# Check specific endpoint
curl -v https://api.caf-mexico.org/health

# Verify DNS resolution
nslookup api.caf-mexico.org

# Test connectivity
ping api.caf-mexico.org
```

#### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Verify test user credentials
curl -X POST https://api.caf-mexico.org/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@caf-mexico.org","password":"TestPassword123"}'

# Check user account status in admin panel
```

#### Load Test Issues
```bash
# Check system resources during load test
top -p $(pgrep node)

# Monitor database connections
# (Connect to your database and check active connections)

# Verify rate limiting isn't blocking tests
curl -I https://api.caf-mexico.org/health
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
# Debug smoke tests
DEBUG=true npm run smoke-tests

# Verbose health monitoring
VERBOSE=true ./health-monitor.sh

# Artillery debug mode
DEBUG=* npm run load-test
```
