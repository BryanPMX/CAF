## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Admin Credentials
```bash
# Set your admin credentials (use your actual admin account)
export ADMIN_EMAIL="your-admin@caf-mexico.org"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-admin-password"
```

### Step 2: Create Test Users (Dry Run First)
```bash
# Test the process safely first
DRY_RUN=true node test-user-manager.js create

# If dry run looks good, create real users
node test-user-manager.js create
```

### Step 3: Run Full Testing Suite
```bash
# Health checks with fixed script
./health-monitor.sh

# Smoke tests with real accounts
npm run smoke-tests

# Integration tests with real accounts
npm run integration-tests

# WebSocket functionality test
node websocket-tester.js basic
```

## 🔧 Detailed Implementation

### 1. Test User Management

#### Create Test Users
```bash
# Set admin credentials
export ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@caf-mexico.org"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourSecurePassword"

# Create all test users
node test-user-manager.js create
```

**Created Test Users:**
- `test-user@caf-test.local` - Regular client user
- `test-staff@caf-test.local` - Staff member
- `test-admin@caf-test.local` - Admin user  
- `test-manager@caf-test.local` - Office manager

#### Security Features
- **Secure passwords**: 16-character random passwords with mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Test domain**: All users use `@caf-test.local` domain for easy identification
- **Role isolation**: Each user has appropriate role permissions
- **Audit trail**: All actions logged and audited
- **Automatic cleanup**: Built-in cleanup functionality

#### Credential Management
```bash
# Credentials are automatically saved to secure files
ls -la .test-credentials.json  # Secure credentials file (600 permissions)
cat .env                       # Updated environment file
```

### 2. Fixed Issues Implementation

#### ✅ Health Monitor Script - FIXED
- **Issue**: Bash associative array syntax error
- **Fix**: Rewritten with compatible array structure
- **Test**: `./health-monitor.sh quick`

#### ✅ WebSocket Endpoint - VERIFIED WORKING
- **Issue**: Appeared to return 404
- **Reality**: Returns proper "missing token" error - endpoint is working correctly
- **Test**: `node websocket-tester.js basic`

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Tools

#### Health Monitoring (Fixed)
```bash
./health-monitor.sh            # Full health check
./health-monitor.sh quick      # Quick check
./health-monitor.sh monitor    # Continuous monitoring
./health-monitor.sh test /health/ready  # Test specific endpoint
```

#### Smoke Testing (With Real Accounts)
```bash
npm run smoke-tests            # Full smoke test suite
DEBUG=true npm run smoke-tests # Debug mode
```

#### Load Testing
```bash
npm run load-test              # Performance validation
artillery run load-test.yml    # Custom load test
```

#### Integration Testing (With Real Accounts)
```bash
npm run integration-tests      # Full integration tests
DRY_RUN=true npm run integration-tests  # Safe dry run
```

#### WebSocket Testing
```bash
node websocket-tester.js basic # Basic WebSocket functionality
node websocket-tester.js load  # WebSocket load test
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Test User Security Features

1. **Isolated Test Domain**
   - All test users use `@caf-test.local`
   - Easy to identify and manage
   - Prevents confusion with real users

2. **Strong Authentication**
   - 16-character secure passwords
   - Mixed case, numbers, symbols
   - Cryptographically random generation

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Each test user has minimal required permissions
   - No access to real user data
   - Proper role isolation

4. **Audit Trail**
   - All test user actions logged
   - Creation and deletion tracked
   - Security audit reports

5. **Secure Credential Storage**
   - Credentials stored with 600 permissions
   - Environment variables for automation
   - No plaintext passwords in code

### Security Audit Process

```bash
# The test user manager includes built-in security auditing
node test-user-manager.js create  # Includes automatic security audit

# Manual security verification
grep -r "@caf-test.local" .       # Find all test references
ls -la .test-credentials.json     # Verify secure permissions
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Health Monitoring
```bash
# Automated health checks (safe to run continuously)
./health-monitor.sh quick

# Set up cron job for continuous monitoring
echo "*/5 * * * * cd $(pwd) && ./health-monitor.sh quick >> logs/health.log 2>&1" | crontab -
```

### Scenario 2: Weekly Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Full system validation
./health-monitor.sh              # Health check
npm run smoke-tests              # Critical paths
npm run load-test                # Performance
node websocket-tester.js basic   # Real-time features
```

### Scenario 3: Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Complete validation before releases
npm run integration-tests        # End-to-end workflows
npm run load-test                # Performance regression
./health-monitor.sh              # System health
```

### Scenario 4: WebSocket Functionality Testing
```bash
# Test real-time notifications
node websocket-tester.js basic   # Basic functionality
node websocket-tester.js load    # Multiple connections
```

## 🔄 Maintenance and Cleanup

### Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Weekly cleanup of test data
node test-user-manager.js cleanup

# Recreate test users if needed
node test-user-manager.js create

# Update test credentials
grep "TEST_.*_EMAIL" .env  # Verify current credentials
```

### Emergency Cleanup
```bash
# Remove all test users immediately
node test-user-manager.js cleanup

# Remove test credentials
rm -f .test-credentials.json

# Clear environment variables
sed -i '' '/TEST_.*=/d' .env
```

### Credential Rotation
```bash
# Rotate test user passwords monthly
node test-user-manager.js cleanup  # Remove old users
node test-user-manager.js create   # Create with new passwords
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Admin Authentication Failed
```bash
# Verify admin credentials
curl -X POST https://api.caf-mexico.org/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-admin@caf-mexico.org","password":"your-password"}'
```

#### Issue 2: Test User Creation Failed
```bash
# Check admin permissions
node test-user-manager.js create  # Review error messages
DRY_RUN=true node test-user-manager.js create  # Test without changes
```

#### Issue 3: WebSocket Connection Failed
```bash
# Test WebSocket endpoint
curl -H "Upgrade: websocket" https://api.caf-mexico.org/ws
# Should return {"error":"missing token"} - this is correct!
```

#### Issue 4: Integration Tests Failing
```bash
# Run in dry-run mode first
DRY_RUN=true npm run integration-tests

# Check test user credentials
cat .test-credentials.json
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Health monitor debug
VERBOSE=true ./health-monitor.sh

# Smoke tests debug  
DEBUG=true npm run smoke-tests

# Integration tests debug
DEBUG=true npm run integration-tests

# WebSocket debug
DEBUG=ws node websocket-tester.js basic
```
